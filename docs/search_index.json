Installation instructions for GEMS and more information about this modeling program can be found on the GEMS team webpage: http://gems.web.psi.ch/GEMS3/techinfo.html. Information about the MINES database and project files for the tutorials can be found under https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/tdb-mines This booklet is subdivided into five modules. Module 1: Create your first project in GEMS and installing the MINES database "],["intro.html", "Module 1 Create your first project in GEMS 1.1 Installing the MINES thermodynamic database 1.2 Creating a new project from scratch 1.3 Your first fluid-rock equilibrium model 1.4 Outcomes", " Module 1 Create your first project in GEMS Here we will learn how to create a new Project, the selection of thermodynamic databases, components and equations of state for your modeling project. We will also explain the project folder structure and how to install the MINES thermodynamic database for modeling hydrothermal fluid-rock interaction and ore-forming processes . You will also learn how to interact basalt with water in your first equilibrium calculations. 1.1 Installing the MINES thermodynamic database The MINES thermodynamic database can be downloaded at https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/tdb (Fig. 1.1). Figure 1.1: The MINES thermodynamic database webpage and files to download. Select the weblink for MINES19. Download and unzip the DB19.default archive folder to Downloads. Select all the database files in this folder and copy them (Fig. 1.2). Merge these database files with the Gems3-app/Resources/DB.default folder by pasting them into DB.default (Fig. 1.3). In Linux this folder is in /Gems3-app/Resources/DB.default; In Mac OSX this folder is in /Applications/gems3 then right-click show package content and go to Contents/Resources/DB.default; In Windows this folder should be in /Gems3-app/Resources/DB.default. The folder structure of the GEMS program, independent of the operating system used, consists of two main folders: Gems3-app The GEMS3-app folder contains the program resources and also a subfolder Resources/ DB.default, which will be used to copy the MINES thermodynamic database files into it. Library/Gems3/projects The projects folder will contain all the projects you create and work on, and will also be the folder in which you can copy the tutorial folders. Figure 1.2: Unzipped DB19.default folder and database files to copy. Figure 1.3: Database files merged with the Gems3-app/Resources/DB.default folder in GEMS. 1.2 Creating a new project from scratch Open GEMS and click New Project in the Modeling Projects window. Give a name to your project (no spaces). The user interface is shown in Figure 1.4. In the next window, you can choose the thermodynamic database for your project. Select the database files 3rdparty/MINES and support, then deselect other databases as shown in Figure 1.5. Click Next. Do not forget, you have an extensive list of minerals included in this database. Once you have gone through the tutorials and are familiar with GEMS, it is suggested that in thermodynamic database mode you switch to the Phase module (Fig. 1.9), and remove minerals that are not relevant for your own specific project. Also, for less advanced users, it is easiedt to not use the ternary non-ideal feldspar solid solution model (ss) but only their end members (i.e., anorthite, albite and microcline). Figure 1.4: GEMS user interface showing the project window. Click on make a New Project and select a project name without spaces. Figure 1.5: Select 3rdparty/mines and support, and for phases select only withoutss. Note that we recommend only advanced users to choose withss; the expanded tab shows pure for endmembers and ss for different solid solution endmembers In the next window choose your system components: H-O-C-Cl-Na-K-Ca-Mg-Al-Fe-Si-Ti (Fig. 1.6). Have you checked you got all of the elements selected? Check again please, then click Next…By doing so, GEMS will automatically look up all phases with these components in the MINES database and copy them into your modeling project! Tip of the day: all your modeling projects you are working on are located under Library/Gems3/projects. Make sure to do regular backups… In the next window you will be able to choose the activity model for your aqueous speciation calculations (e.g. “Debye-Hückel”, Davies equation, …), and the EOS for gases. For now, follow Figure 1.7 using the extended “Debye-Hückel” equation (Helgeson), check the parameters and click Check for the aqueous speciation model. This model is ideal for modeling H\\(_2\\)O-NaCl aqueous solutions (with NaCl as background electrolyte) at hydrothermal conditions at relatively moderate salinities observed in many ore deposits. Then you can switch to the gas EOS model tab and choose the Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PRSV) model and click Check (Fig. 1.7). That’s it, now you are ready to model your first equilibrium model! Note: this model is for non-ideal gases, and for this purpose a new phase with the acronym (f) was added to the MINES database with all the relevant parameters using the PRSV EOS. Else the choice would be the ideal gas law with a phase using the acronym (g) Figure 1.6: Select here the composition of the system. All phases containing these elements will automatically be loaded from the MINES database into your project. Figure 1.7: Select here the activity model for aqueous speciation (a-d) and the EOS model for gases (e-g). 1.3 Your first fluid-rock equilibrium model In the next window, you will be able to define the name of your first fluid-rock system equilibrium (SysEq) calculations and set the pressure and temperature (Fig. 1.8). Add a name without spaces and P-T conditions, i.e. we choose basalt-fluid, 250 \\(^{\\circ}\\)C for T and 1 kbar for P. Next window we select our ingredients and add 1000 g of H\\(_2\\)O (Aqua), 200 g of NaCl, 5 g Gas CO\\(_2\\) and 500 g of basalt (Fig. 1.8). Click OK. Finally, you can click on Calculate BCC followed by Calculate equilibrium with GEM as shown in (Fig. 1.9). You can easily create another system by selecting Clone a new record from this one and change the fluid/rock ratio or temperature and see what what happens with the results. Figure 1.8: GEM-Selektor user interface showing the windows to create a new equilibrium system and define pressure (P) and temperature (T) for our first calculation. Figure 1.9: GEM-Selektor user interface showing how to Calculate BCC followed by Calculate equilibrium with GEMS. Also shown are the Equilibrium Calculation mode and the Thermodynamic database mode, where you can inspect the MINES database. 1.4 Outcomes Congratulations! In Module 1 you learned how to install the MINES thermodynamic database in your Resources/DB.default GEMS folder, the general folder structure of GEMS, how to setup your first project and how to run your first fluid-rock equilibrium calculations in GEMS.

You will also learn how to set up an automated cooling process simulation and plot results from multiple simulations. We will use the GEMS project file “Module2” that can be found either in the /Tutorial/Module2_fsp-reaction/unsolved workshop folder or download it directly here. 2.1 Compute the chemical equilibrium of single chemical systems (SysEq) Figure 2.1: GEMS user interface showing the Equilibria Calculation and Thermodynamic Database modes. Copy the entire unzipped Module2 folder into your GEMS project directory located in Library/Gems3/projects. More information on the GEMS folder structure can be found in Module 1. Open GEMS and choose the project in the Equilibria Calculation Mode. The user interface is shown in Figure 2.1. Panel 1 permits to create new records and run the program for calculations. Panel 2 gives you different calculation options. Choose the Create a new record from scratch from the menu in Panel 1 and fill the parameters listed in Figure 2.2 In the Open recipe dialog, which can also be found in Panel 1, add phases, quantity and units as shown in Figure 2.3; Aqua (1000 g), HCl (0.1 M), NaCl (50 g), O\\(_{2(g)}\\) (1e-7) and K-feldspar (10 g). Figure 2.2: New record window. Select a name without spaces, a temperature and a pressure for your system. Note that a pressure of 0 corresond to saturated water vapor pressure. Figure 2.3: System recipe dialog. Model the chemical equilibrium between 10 g of K-feldspar (microcline) and H\\(_2\\)O at 150 \\(^\\circ\\)C by pressing Calculate BCC followed by Calculate Equilibrium in Panel 1. Inspect the pop up window with pH, redox (eH) and phase proportions, then accept. – Determine the pH of this system as shown in the lower right of the main window (Fig. 2.4). – What is the pH of this system with 10, 20, 50 and 100 g K-feldspar? Change the amount of feldspar by clicking the Open recipe dialog followed by Calculate BCC and by Calculate Equilibrium. What minerals are stable with increasing pH? Finally, clone your existing Rct_path_1 chemical system by selecting it and choosing Clone a new record from this one in Panel 1 (Fig. 1.1). Change the name to Rct_path_2 and the temperature to 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C in the pop up window, and recalculate the equilibrium of this system. – Determine the pH of this system as shown in the lower right of the main window. – What is the pH of this system with 10, 20, 50 and 100 g K-feldspar? What minerals are stable with increasing pH? – Are there differences between the modeled system at 150 and 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C Figure 2.4: Results of the calculations, i.e. with 10 g K-feldspar added to the fluid. 2.2 Compute processes using a titration model (Process, S mode) The previous part of this tutorial showed you how to do individual SysEq calculations. What if you want to automate this process and calculate the equilibria of 10 to 100 g feldspar in steps and plot the results, i.e. a titration model? In the following we will see how to set up Process simulations. Select the Process option in Panel 2 (Fig. 2.1). Click Create a record from scratch in Panel 1 and select your parent chemical system SysEq calculated previously at 150 \\(^\\circ\\)C (Fig. 2.5). Name this process simulation “titration_150C” and use the Process simulation code (S) as shown in Figures 2.6) and 2.7). In the next window, choose a model (titration cNu linear), a mineral ( Compos, Min_K-feldspar) and select the temperature (150 \\(^\\circ\\)C), pressure (0 for water vapor saturation P) and amount of mineral to be added (iNu: 10-250 g in 10 g steps) as shown in Figure 2.8. The parameters are: set iTm 1000, 1200, 1; set iP to 0 all fields; set iNu 10, 250, 10, corresponding to start, end, and step values. Select items to be plotted (Scalars: pH; Xa: Kaolinite, Pyrophyllite, Microcline, Muscovite, Albite and Quartz) as shown in Figure 2.9. Accept all the following dialogues. Then click on Save this record to database in Panel 1, which creates your new process simulation record. Then click on the calculator icon Re-calculate and check record data without displaying the graph. Figure 2.5: Select a parent chemical system (SysEq) for modeling a Process. Figure 2.6: Name the Process simulator and indicate the model type (note: the process type code names are described and changeable on the next screen as well). Figure 2.7: Window showing the different simulations types. Module 2 covers mode S for titration or mode P for cooling/heating models. Figure 2.8: Set the parameters for the Process simulation; Set iTm 1000, 1200, 1; Set iP to 0 all fields; Set iNu 10, 250, 10. Figure 2.9: Choose the results to be plotted, including pH and mole minerals. There is a tab menu with 3 important selections: Controls, Sampling and Results. In the Controls tab add a description of the modeling project (Fig. 2.10). In the Sampling tab change the script as shown in Figure 2.11 to choose as x-variable the amount of K-feldspar added (the process extent variable cNu). Click Save this record to database. Toggle to the Results tab to inspect your modeling results. Then click on the calculator icon Re-calculate and check record data and check what happens with the column xp. You just assigned the cNu variable to the x-axis and GEMS registered it. If not, go back on the Sampling tab and check your script! Now lets inspect the results… – How many grams of K-feldspar need to be added to get a constant pH and what is the value? – Which mineral assemblages buffer the fluid pH and can pH ranges be distinguished? Figure 2.10: The Controls window showing the model conditions. The top dialog is used to add a comment and the script dialog can be customized. iTm is used to set the record variable; iP to set pressure and iTC temperature; iNu is the process variable, in this case the amount of feldspar. Figure 2.11: The Sampling window showing the x- and y-axes to be sampled. Make sure to change xp[J] to cNu which is the progress variable. Then click on a blank space to make sure the script window has been registered followed by Save this record in the database in the top panel. 2.3 Change P-T of the titration model Now lets clone our record to calculate the exact same titration model but changing the temperature (T) to 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C and the pressure (P) to 500 bar. Clone your existing process simulation by selecting the existing record on the left and choose Clone a new record, then select your SysEq parent system calculated at 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C (Fig. 2.12). Accept all the following dialogues. In the Controls tab change the description of the modeling project and change the temperature to 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C and pressure to 500 bar to replace the starting and ending values (Fig. 2.13). Click Save this record to database. Switch the tab to Results and click the calculator icon Re-calculate and check record data to see how the pH values and moles minerals are changed by increasing the system temperature. Toggle between both calculated process simulations at 150 and 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C on the left pane and compare the results. Figure 2.12: The Sampling window showing the x- and y-axes to be sampled. Make sure to change xp[J] to cNu which is the progress variable. Then click on a blank space to make sure the script window has been registered followed by Save this record in the database in the top panel. Figure 2.13: The Controls window showing a model set up at a different temperture and pressure. 2.4 Tweak and plot the results What are the main differences for the simulations at 150 vs. 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C? To make a better comparison lets fine tune the models and plot them! Select the process simulation you generated previously at 150 \\(^\\circ\\)C and in the Controls tab change the amount of K-feldspar to be added using 2 to 50 g in 2 g steps and save. Choose the Results tab and click the calculator icon Re-calculate and check record data. Click on the small Plot data on Graph dialog in Panel 1. The resulting graph should look similar to Figure 2.14. The plots indicate different mineral assemblage buffer the fluid at different pH values. You can inspect which minerals by choosing the Customize button with values shown in . – The resulting reaction path at 150 \\(^\\circ\\)C is shown in . – The resulting reaction path at 300 \\(^\\circ\\)C is shown in \\autoref{fig:process1j.jpeg Figure 2.14: Simulated K-feldspar reaction path show pH and moles minerals in equilibrium with a saline aqueous fluid at 150 °C and saturated water vapor pressure. 2.5 Compute processes using a cooling model (Process, P mode) Or what if you want to calculate the equilibria between feldspar and the aqueous fluid at 150 to 250 \\(^\\circ\\)C in steps, i.e. a cooling model?

Installation instructions for GEMS and more information about this modeling program can be found on the GEMS team webpage: http://gems.web.psi.ch/GEMS3/techinfo.html. Information about the MINES database and project files for the tutorials can be found under https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/tdb This booklet is subdivided into five modules. Module 1: Create your first project in GEMS and installing the MINES database "]]

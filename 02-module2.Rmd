# Feldspar reaction path {#module2}

In this tutorial, you will learn to model the reaction path of K-feldspar in contact with a NaCl-bearing aqueous solution and calculate the evolution of the fluid and the minerals formed as a function of increased fluid-rock interaction. You will also learn how to set up  an automated cooling process simulation and plot results from multiple simulations. We will use the GEMS project file "Module2" that can be found either in the /Tutorial/Module2_fsp-reaction/unsolved workshop folder or download it directly [here](https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/mines-tdb/GEMS-files/Module2.zip). 

## Compute the chemical equilibrium of single chemical systems (SysEq)
```{r,fig-1b, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="GEMS user interface showing the `Equilibria Calculation` and `Thermodynamic Database` modes."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-1.jpg")
```

- Copy the entire unzipped Module2 folder into your GEMS project directory located in Library/Gems3/projects. More information on the GEMS folder structure can be found in [Module 1](#intro). 

- Open GEMS and choose the project in the `Equilibria Calculation Mode`. The user interface is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1b). Panel 1 permits to create new records and run the program for calculations. Panel 2 gives you different calculation options. 

- Choose the `Create a new record from scratch` from the menu in Panel 1 and fill the parameters listed in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-2b)

- In the `Open recipe dialog`, which can also be found in Panel 1, add  phases, quantity and units as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3b); Aqua (1000 g), HCl (0.1 M), NaCl (50 g), O$_{2(g)}$ (1e-7) and K-feldspar (10 g).

```{r,fig-2b, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="New record window. Select a name without spaces, a temperature and a pressure for your system. Note that a pressure of 0 corresond to saturated water vapor pressure."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-2.jpg")
```

```{r,fig-3b, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="System recipe dialog."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-3.png")
```

- Model the chemical equilibrium between 10 g of K-feldspar (microcline) and H$_2$O at 150 $^\circ$C by pressing `Calculate BCC` followed by `Calculate Equilibrium` in Panel 1. Inspect the pop up window with pH, redox (eH) and phase proportions, then accept.

  -- Determine the pH of this system as shown in the lower right of the main window (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-4b)).

  -- What is the pH of this system with 10, 20, 50 and 100 g K-feldspar? Change the amount of feldspar by clicking the `Open recipe dialog` followed by `Calculate BCC` and by `Calculate Equilibrium`. What minerals are stable with increasing pH?
	
- Finally, clone your existing Rct_path_1 chemical system by selecting it and choosing `Clone a new record from this one`	in Panel 1 (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-1)). Change the name to Rct_path_2 and the temperature to 300 $^\circ$C in the pop up window, and recalculate the equilibrium of this system.

  -- Determine the pH of this system as shown in the lower right of the main window.
	 	
  -- What is the pH of this system with 10, 20, 50 and 100 g K-feldspar? What minerals are stable with increasing pH?
	
  -- Are there differences between the modeled system at 150 and 300 $^\circ$C

## Compute processes using a titration model (Process, S mode)

The previous part of this tutorial showed you how to do individual `SysEq` calculations. What if you want to automate this process and calculate the equilibria of 10 to 100 g feldspar in steps and plot the results, i.e. a titration model? In the following we will see how to set up `Process` simulations.

- Select the `Process` option in Panel 2 (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-1b)).

- Click `Create a record from scratch` in Panel 1 and select your parent chemical system `SysEq` calculated previously at 150 $^\circ$C (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-5b)). 

- Name this process simulation "titration_150C" and use the `Process simulation code` (S) as shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-6b)) and \@ref(fig:fig-7b)). 

- In the next window, choose a model (`titration cNu linear`), a mineral ( `Compos`, Min_K-feldspar) and select the temperature (150 $^\circ$C), pressure (0 for water vapor saturation P) and amount of mineral to be added (`iNu`: 10-250 g in 10 g steps) as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-8b). The parameters are: set `iTm` 1000, 1200, 1; set `iP` to 0 all fields; set `iNu` 10, 250, 10, corresponding to start, end, and step values.
	
- Select items to be plotted (`Scalars`: pH;  `Xa`: Kaolinite, Pyrophyllite, Microcline, Muscovite, Albite and Quartz) as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-9b).

- Accept all the following dialogues. Then click on `Save this record to database` in Panel 1, which creates your new process simulation record. Then click on the calculator icon `Re-calculate and check record data` without displaying the graph.


```{r,fig-5b, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Select a parent chemical system (`SysEq`) for modeling a `Process`."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-5.png")
```
```{r,fig-6b, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Name the `Process` simulator and indicate the model type (note: the process type code names are described and changeable on the next screen as well)."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-6.png")
```

```{r,fig-7b, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap="Window showing the different simulations types. Module 2 covers `mode S` for titration  or `mode P` for cooling/heating models."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-7.png")
```
```{r,fig-8b, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap="Set the parameters for the `Process` simulation; Set `iTm` 1000, 1200, 1; Set `iP` to 0 all fields; Set `iNu` 10, 250, 10."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-8.png")
```

```{r,fig-9b, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap="Choose the results to be plotted, including pH and mole minerals."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-9.png")
```

- There is a tab menu with 3 important selections: `Controls`, `Sampling` and `Results`. In the `Controls` tab add a description of the modeling project (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-10b)). In the `Sampling` tab change the script as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-11b) to choose as x-variable the amount of K-feldspar added (the process extent variable `cNu`). 

- Click `Save this record to database`. Toggle to the `Results` tab to inspect your modeling results. Then click on the calculator icon `Re-calculate and check record data` and check what happens with the column xp. You just assigned the `cNu` variable to the x-axis and GEMS registered it. If not, go back on the `Sampling` tab and check your script! Now lets inspect the results... 
 
	-- How many grams of K-feldspar need to be added to get a constant pH and what is the value?
	 	
	-- Which mineral assemblages buffer the fluid pH and can pH ranges be distinguished?
		
```{r,fig-10b, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The `Controls` window showing the model conditions. The top dialog is used to add a comment and the script dialog can be customized. `iTm` is used to set the record variable; `iP` to set pressure and `iTC` temperature; `iNu` is the process variable, in this case the amount of feldspar."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-10.png")
```

```{r,fig-11b, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The `Sampling` window showing the x- and y-axes to be sampled. Make sure to change `xp[J]` to `cNu` which is the progress variable. Then click on a blank space to make sure the script window has been registered followed by `Save this record in the database` in the top panel."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-11.png")
```

## Change P-T of the titration model
Now lets clone our record to calculate the exact same titration model but  changing the temperature (T) to 300 $^\circ$C and the pressure (P) to 500 bar.

- Clone your existing process simulation by selecting the existing record on the left and choose `Clone a new record`, then select your `SysEq` parent system calculated at 300 $^\circ$C (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-12b)). Accept all the following dialogues. 

- In the `Controls` tab change the description of the modeling project and change the temperature to 300 $^\circ$C and pressure to 500 bar to replace the starting and ending values (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-13b)). Click `Save this record to database`.

- Switch the tab to `Results` and click the calculator icon `Re-calculate and check record data` to see how the pH values and moles minerals are changed by increasing the system temperature.

- Toggle between both calculated process simulations at 150 and 300 $^\circ$C on the left pane and compare the results. 
		
```{r,fig-12b, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="The `Sampling` window showing the x- and y-axes to be sampled. Make sure to change `xp[J]` to `cNu` which is the progress variable. Then click on a blank space to make sure the script window has been registered followed by `Save this record in the database` in the top panel."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-12.png")
```

```{r,fig-13b, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="The `Controls` window showing a model set up at a different temperture and pressure."} 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/module2/fig-13.png")
```

## Tweak and plot the results 

What are the main differences for the simulations at 150 vs. 300 $^\circ$C? To make a better comparison lets fine tune the models and plot them!
	
- Select the process simulation you generated previously at 150 $^\circ$C and in the  `Controls` tab change the amount of K-feldspar to be added using 2 to 50 g in 2 g steps and save. 

- Choose the `Results` tab and click the calculator icon `Re-calculate and check record data`. Click on the small `Plot data on Graph dialog` in Panel 1. The resulting graph should look similar to Figure \@ref(fig:fig-14b). The plots indicate different mineral assemblage buffer the fluid at different pH values. You can inspect which minerals by choosing the Customize button with values shown in \autoref{fig:process1h.jpeg}.

-- The resulting reaction path at 150 $^\circ$C is shown in \autoref{fig:process1i.jpeg}.

-- The resulting reaction path at 300 $^\circ$C is shown in \autoref{fig:process1j.jpeg

```{r,fig-14b, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Simulated K-feldspar reaction path show pH and moles minerals in equilibrium with a saline aqueous fluid at 150 °C and saturated water vapor pressure."}

## Compute processes using a cooling model (Process, P mode)

Or what if you want to calculate the equilibria between feldspar and the aqueous fluid at 150 to 250 $^\circ$C in steps, i.e. a cooling model?
